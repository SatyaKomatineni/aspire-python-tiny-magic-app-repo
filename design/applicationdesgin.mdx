# Design thoughts on applications
*****************************************
Main ideas:

1. Configuration objects
2. How interfaces can indicate their constructor dependencies!
3. Docs: Application classes, interfaces and implementations
4. Dual instantiations
5. Optimize factory object cache locking for non singletons
6. Equivalence of factory invocation and direct instantiation
7. How do you know what object to pass to the factory instantiation?
8. Tracing Log specs: initialization
9. An alternate design for bootstrapping and initialization

## Configuration objects
*****************************************
1. Provide for configuration data objects
2. By extending or tagging as ConfigObject the factory will fill and return
3. One way to objectify configuration with or without behavior
4. A future factory implementation can do that


## How interfaces can indicate their constructor dependencies!
*****************************************
1. Have the factory take an "object" as part of its construction
2. Let the interface provide a class method that could take arguments and return an object of the right type!
3. Pass that method to the factory
4. factory will then initialize the derived classes with that object

### cautions
*****************************************
1. There could be a class of implementations where the constructor could differ
2. Example: filename based configurations vs database based configurations!
3. This "knowledge" is ensconced  in the "implementation" and not in the interface!!
4. Have hybrid interfaces (factories) like "FileBasedConfig" that knows the args of that class

## Docs: Application classes, interfaces and implementations
*****************************************
tbd

# Dual instantiations
***************************
1. Factory classes assume that they are instantiated from configuration
2. Some times you may want to instantiate them programmatically like say when you want to test them
3. Provide an approach for it
4. Is that through a constructor? or an explicit disciplined init method?
5. Or through dependency injection to unify both methods?

# Optimize factory object cache locking for non singletons
*****************************************
1. Right now the cache is locked for multi instance classes every time
2. Although a class doesnt require caching, one may not know that until the object is instantiated
3. Couple of ways
    1. Ask the class itself and not the object instance for that decision
    2. Provide a hint in the config file against that class (probably not)

# Equivalence of factory invocation and direct instantiation
***************************
1. A good example is below
2. TOMLConfig vs BaseTOMLConfig
3. TOMLConfig -> Instantiation through ConfigObject
4. BaseTOMLConfig -> Direct instantiation
5. See BaseApplication
6. See ConfigApplication for an example
7. uses "_init" which can get called from initialiazers and also derived class __init__ methods
8. When the factory is enabled for Dependency ingection this can be revisited.

# How do you know what object to pass to the factory instantiation?
***************************
1. Look at the target object
2. If it implement IInitializable, pass None
3. If it implements IInitializableWithArgs, pass that specific type of object
4. You have to look at the source code of that object
5. This means all targets of that interface belongs to that class of objects

# Tracing Log specs: initialization
***************************
1. Application initialization heading with a config filename
2. Instantiate the base application with log, config, and basefactory
3. Creating the real application log, config, base factory
4. Assing the new application
5. Report what are the app objects used for 
    log: 
    config:
    factory:
    application:
6. Sing off the application

# An alternate design for bootstrapping and initialization
***************************
1. What do you loose if you explicitly initialize the AppObjects explicitly
2. Instead of the the config file as the route?
3. May be provide that option as part of the library.
