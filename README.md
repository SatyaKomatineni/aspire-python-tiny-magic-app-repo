# aspire-python-tiny-magic-app-repo
A tiny framework for applications in python. Based on its java counter part. Abstracts out an application via abstractions using a magic factory, configuration, and logging.

# Goals
1. Allow declarative programming
2. Give equal weightage to declarative and procedural side of programming
3. Inherent Backward compatibility
4. Reduce learning curve and democratize writing applications. Onboard new programmers easily using pre-built components. 

# Suitability
1. Web applications
2. AI applications
3. Command line applications
4. Data Integrations
5. API development

# Background
1. Based on a Java framework I had for years that proved to be quite invaluable in all the stated goals
2. Over 20 years old
