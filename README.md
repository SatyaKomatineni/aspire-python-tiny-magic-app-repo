# aspire-python-tiny-magic-app-repo
A tiny framework for applications in python. Based on its java counter part. Abstracts out an application via abstractions using a magic factory, configuration, and logging.

# Goals
1. Allow declarative programming
2. Give equal weightage to declarative and procedural side of programming
3. Inherent Backward compatibility
4. **Reduce learning curve and democratize writing applications.** Onboard new programmers easily using pre-built components. 
5. Components

# Technical Bells
6. Declarative execution pipelines
6. Expression languages
7. Dependency ingection
8. Unified configuration 
9. Magic factory

# Suitability
1. Web applications
2. AI applications
3. Command line applications
4. Data Integrations
5. API development

# Background
1. Based on a Java framework I had for years that proved to be quite invaluable in all the stated goals
2. Over 20 years old

# Caution
1. New to python
2. May be doing number of things odd or different or inefficient. Will mature
3. Borrow the code and adjust as you need
4. Drop me a line if you want to see changes/updates/suggestions/help

# Done 3/19/24
1. Write code
2. Write and pass Basic Test battery
3. Create dedicated repo
4. Move code into the dedicated repo

# Done 4/1/24
5. Reorg the directories correctly. They are not the most optimal at the moment
6. Fix type errors due to reorged directories
7. Make the tests work after directory shifting

# Currently working on /1/24
1. Dependency injection
2. Test factories along with dependency injection

# Next set and likely date (Mid April)
1. Reorganize tests so that they are readable and meaningful

# Backlog
2. Strengthen test batteries
3. Use it in an ai langchain project with RAG and Agents
4. Take a swipe at pip install.
5. Fix individual local tests for each of the files. Or move them to test batteries. Or delete the code if not needed.
6. Move directory related file utils to start using the config file
7. Optimize by classifying logging methods throughout the app
