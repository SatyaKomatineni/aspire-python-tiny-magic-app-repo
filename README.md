# aspire-python-tiny-magic-app-repo
A tiny framework for applications in python. Based on its java counter part. Abstracts out an application via abstractions using a magic factory, configuration, and logging.

# Goals
1. Allow declarative programming
2. Give equal weightage to declarative and procedural side of programming
3. Inherent Backward compatibility
4. **Reduce learning curve and democratize writing applications.** Onboard new programmers easily using pre-built components. 

# Suitability
1. Web applications
2. AI applications
3. Command line applications
4. Data Integrations
5. API development

# Background
1. Based on a Java framework I had for years that proved to be quite invaluable in all the stated goals
2. Over 20 years old

# Caution
1. New to python
2. May be doing number of things odd or different or inefficient. Will mature
3. Borrow the code and adjust as you need
4. Drop me a line if you want to see changes/updates/suggestions/help

# Done 3/19/24
1. Write code
2. Basic Test battery
3. Move it into a dedicated repo

# Backlog
1. Reorg the directories correctly. They are not the most optimal at the moment
2. Strengthen test batteries
3. Use it in an ai langchain project with RAG and Agents
4. Take a swipe at pip install.
